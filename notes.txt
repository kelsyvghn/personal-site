          * Project: a mobile fitness application that utilizes React Native to track workout routines and maintain a record of weights, reps, and time spent on various muscle groups in order to track and maintain a better workout regime.
* My goal was to make a user-friendly application that I might use to track different routines when I workout, so Iâ€™m not scrambling to remember what I did last time or what weight set I was at.
* React-Native, MongoDB, Node/Express
