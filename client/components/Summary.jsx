            <p>Hello! Welcome to my personal website!</p>
<p>I am a Full Stack Software Engineer that specializes in Javascript/React/Node.js.</p>
<p>Recently, I separated from the U.S. Navy where I worked on networks, communications and other electronic systems.</p> 
<p>Creativity and technology have always been a big part of my life and every day it excites me to bring my experiences together in developing software.</p> 
<p>I love creating applications from start to finish, backend to frontend because it's so fulfilling to see an idea come to fruition. 
    Of course, it's also fun to be able to put time and detail into something too, and that's why I'm always up for anything as a Software Engineer. Click on a link below to connect, or if you want to know more. I have some recent projects you can view on YouTube or a resume below!
