            <p>Hello! Welcome to my personal website!</p>
<p>I am a <b>Full Stack Software Engineer</b> that uses many languages, but especially <b>Javascript/React/Node.js</b>.</p>
<p>It's been noted more than a few times that I'm a <i>perfectionist</i> but really I just believe that everything has a <i>perfect</i> state,
and that state could constantly be evolving. I think this should always be recognized and things should change when it suits their growth.</p>
<p>I seperated from the U.S. Navy in January 2020, but I started my programming career quite some time before then when I realized I <i>could</i> do such things.</p>
<p>While I was in the Navy, I was an <b>Everything Technician</b>... okay, not actually... but I was called this a lot as an Electronics Technician, 
where I was responsible for nearly anything that had an electrical pulse. From network maintenance to communications, radios, radars, and even weapons, I handled it <i>all</i> even fixing 
Xbox's and Playstations when they broke while we we're deployed <i>(probably my most important job somedays...)</i>.</p> 
<p>But I digress. The point is technology and creative problem solving has always been a big part of my life.
    I love fixing, breaking, developing, and creating whatever I can, and whatever inspires.
</p>
<p>And nothing excites me more than to bring my experiences together in developing better software and intuitive design.</p> 
<p>As a Full Stack Software Engineer, I love creating applications from start to finish, backend to frontend, because it's so fulfilling to see an idea come to fruition. 
    Of course, it's also fun to be able to put time and detail into something too and that's why I'm always up for anything as a Software Engineer. 
</p>
    <p>
    I'm so glad you decided to join me here, on a single stop of my journey, and if ever you wish to connect or know more, I've got some links below that 
    are just <i>waiting</i> to be activated.
